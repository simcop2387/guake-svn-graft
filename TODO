Guake Todo
==========

 * Finish Preferences window

 * finish setup.py installation script

 * Make dbus interface works

 * Pynotify can be used to notify when guake is opened

 * Talk about egg.trayicon existance in this project =D

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them

 * Maybe create a namespace to store all standard messages, specialy errors and warnings, and so, use gettext in them ! Obvious :) 

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab
	# remove current tab
	# Set window size, here we will set only 10 default sizes:
		# Ctrl-Super-1 -> set to 10% of window
		...
		# Ctrl-Super-0 -> set to 100% of window

 * Use pynotify to show all errors

 * Create or install a default schema to gconf to keep out configuration errors

 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment =D (but is important to store the
   svg `source files' to edit them later)
