Guake Todo
==========

 - DONE * Code cleanup (Lincoln)

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them
 
 - DONE * Add a feature to set the scrollback history lines in the terminal,
   so add a entry in prefs window to setup it
     
 - DONE * Error handling to can take a default action if something external
   fails. Example:
      When try to load configs from gconf, trying to get a int, but with a
      string in gconf schema, it make a segmentation fault. A error handling
      will come like a piece in a jigsaw :)

 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment (but is important to store the svg `source files'
   to edit them later)

 - DONE * Finish Preferences window (Gabriel)

 - DONE * Make translation works (Lincoln)

 * Maybe create a little class to can take a debug over all program. We can
      setup a FLAG when creating the instance of the "debugger" so we turn
      it ON or OFF, when "ON" messages will be printed along all the parts
      of guake. (This is just an idea)

 * Bug hunting

    - DONE - Guake is appearing on the task list. (Lincoln)

    - DONE - Added a option for this on prefs window: Guake window must hide
      when lose focus. NO! discard it! Some users like to do other things with
      guake opened and above it.

    - Some times, when guake opens, it does not grabs the focus.

    - When guake is hidden/shown the cursor is appearing on bottom,
    only happens when animate_show/hide is enabled. (Lincoln)

 * Release the first alpha version

 * Pynotify
    can be used to notify when guake is opened
    to show all errors

 * Implement a little option in prefs dialog to set status icon visibility

 * Put a shortcut in gnome menu: System->Preferences-> Guake
 
    - This will show the guake preferences, so user will can configure guake thought without the statusicon shown

 * Make that the right click on VTE show a context menu with all options of statusicon menu but show_hide

 * Remove the method update_ui() and threadfy the process of animate show and hide.

    - I think this can optimize the show/hide.

 * Show error when keybind fails - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

 * Maybe create a namespace to store all standard messages, specialy errors
   and warnings.

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab OK
	# remove current tab (I use ctrl+d, maybe a way to explain to the user...)
	# Set window size, here we will set only 10 default sizes:
		# Ctrl-Super-1 -> set to 10% of window
		# Ctrl-Super-0 -> set to 100% of window 

 * Add to preferences window:

   - History size

   - Visual bell

   - Audio bell

 * Bug hunting

 * Release alpha2

 * Release the first beta

 * Release the stable version of Guake!!!
