Guake Todo
==========

 * Finish Preferences window

 * finish setup.py installation script

 * Make dbus interface works

 * Pynotify can be used to notify when guake is opened

 * Talk about egg.trayicon existance in this project =D

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them

 * Maybe create a namespace to store all standard messages, specialy errors and warnings, and so, use gettext in them ! Obvious :) 

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab
	# remove current tab
	# Set window size, here we will set only 10 default sizes:
		# Ctrl-Super-1 -> set to 10% of window
		...
		# Ctrl-Super-0 -> set to 100% of window

 * Use pynotify to show all errors

 * Create or install a default schema to gconf to keep out configuration errors

 * Show error when keybind fails
 
 * Maybe create a lock on /var/lock or /tmp/.guake#timestamp# to determine if only one instance of guake are openned. Or maybe use dbus for it.
    # It will need a special care putting a timestamp on lock and updating the timestamp of lock, because if guake crashes and user try to open guake, it will not open because have a lock.
    # if using timestamp in lock guake can check if current timestamp is too old, and them choice to start or suicide.
 
 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment =D (but is important to store the
   svg `source files' to edit them later)

 * Provide an autotools based installation (Lincoln)
