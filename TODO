Guake Todo
==========

 - DONE * Code cleanup (Lincoln)

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them
 
 - DONE * Add a feature to set the scrollback history lines in the terminal,
   so add a entry in prefs window to setup it
     
 - DONE * Error handling to can take a default action if something external
   fails. Example:
      When try to load configs from gconf, trying to get a int, but with a
      string in gconf schema, it make a segmentation fault. A error handling
      will come like a piece in a jigsaw :)

 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment (but is important to store the svg `source files'
   to edit them later)

 - DONE * Finish Preferences window (Gabriel)

 - DONE * Make translation works (Lincoln)

 * Bug hunting

    - DONE - Guake is appearing on the task list. (Lincoln)

    - DONE - Added a option for this on prefs window: Guake window must hide
      when lose focus. NO! discard it! Some users like to do other things with
      guake opened and above it.

    - Some times, when guake opens, it does not grabs the focus.

    - When guake is hidden/shown the cursor is appearing on bottom,
    only happens when animate_show/hide is enabled. (Lincoln)

 * Release the first alpha version

 * Pynotify
    can be used to notify when guake is opened
    to show all errors

 * Show error when keybind fails - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

 * Maybe create a namespace to store all standard messages, specialy errors
   and warnings.

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab OK
	# remove current tab (I use ctrl+d, maybe a way to explain to the user...)
	# Set window size, here we will set only 10 default sizes:
		# Ctrl-Super-1 -> set to 10% of window
		# Ctrl-Super-0 -> set to 100% of window 

 * Add to preferences window:

   - History size

   - Visual bell

   - Audio bell

 * Bug hunting

 * Release alpha2

 * Release the first beta

 * Release the stable version of Guake!!!
