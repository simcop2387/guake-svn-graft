Guake Todo
==========

 * Finish Preferences window

 * finish setup.py installation script

 * Make dbus interface works

 * Pynotify can be used to notify when guake is opened

 * Talk about egg.trayicon existance in this project =D

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them

 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment =D (but is important to store the
   svg `source files' to edit them later)
