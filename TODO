Guake Todo
==========

 * Code cleanup (Lincoln)

 * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them

 * Maybe convert all svg images to png, we needn't vetorial
   graphics at this moment =D (but is important to store the
   svg `source files' to edit them later)

 * Finish Preferences window

 * Make translation works (Lincoln)

 * Bug hunting =)

    - Guake is appearing on the task list. OK

    - Guake window must hide when lose focus.

    - Some times, when guake opens, it does not grabs the focus.

    - When guake is hidden/shown the cursor is appearing on bottom without any
      reason.

 * Release the first alpha version

 * Pynotify
    can be used to notify when guake is opened
    to show all errors

 * Show error when keybind fails

 * Maybe create a namespace to store all standard messages, specialy errors and warnings, and so, use gettext in them ! Obvious :) 

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab
	# remove current tab
	# Set window size, here we will set only 10 default sizes:
		# Ctrl-Super-1 -> set to 10% of window
		...
		# Ctrl-Super-0 -> set to 100% of window 

 * Add to preferences window:

   - History size

   - Visual bell

   - Audio bell

 * Bug hunting

 * Release alpha2

 * Release the first beta

 * Release the stable version of Guake!!!
