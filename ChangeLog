Guake
=====

2007-05-30 Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>

	* autogen.sh: Sending all parameters from this to gnome-autogen.sh.

	* configure.ac: Adding more two expanded variables (BINDIR and DATADIR) and
	adding more two output files.

	* TODO: Updating with closed things.

	* src/guake_globals.py.in: Changing paths to be more customizable by the
	configure script.

	* data/Makefile.am: Adding desktop file, dbus service file and schema file.

	* data/guake.desktop.in,
	* data/org.gnome.Guake.service.in: Added

2007-05-27 Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>
	* data/guake.glade,
	* data/prefs.glade,
	* data/about.glade: Removing image path references, because libglade does
	not have a parameter to set `pixmap dir', so we make it in python.

	* src/guake: Renamed to src/guake.in

	* src/guake.in: Added to be the main script instead of guake.py, it only calls
	guake.run function.

	* m4/*: Added.

	* configure.ac: Adding m4 as macro dir, adding a call to AS_AC_EXPAND set
	LIBDIR with libdir value and adding `src/guake' as an output file.

	* src/Makefile.am: Changing guake dir from prefix/bin to bindir. It was
	made to able the user to change bin dir with the `configure' script.

	* src/common.py,
	* src/guake.py: datapath function was splitted in pixmapfile and gladefile
	functions because if this project doesn't stop to grow, we will separate
	images from glade files in data dir.

	* src/guake.py: Adding image references told above and some code cleanup.
