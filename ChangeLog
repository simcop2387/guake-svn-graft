	* data/guake.glade,
	* data/prefs.glade,
	* data/about.glade: Removing image path references, because libglade does
	not have a parameter to set `pixmap dir', so we make it in python.

	* src/guake: Renamed to src/guake.in

	* src/guake.in: Added to be the main script instead of guake.py, it only calls
	guake.run function.

	* m4/*: Added.

	* configure.ac: Adding m4 as macro dir, adding a call to AS_AC_EXPAND set
	LIBDIR with libdir value and adding `src/guake' as an output file.

	* src/Makefile.am: Changing guake dir from prefix/bin to bindir. It was
	made to able the user to change bin dir with the `configure' script.

	* src/common.py,
	* src/guake.py: datapath function was splitted in pixmapfile and gladefile
	functions because if this project doesn't stop to grow, we will separate
	images from glade files in data dir.

	* src/guake.py: Adding image references told above and some code cleanup.
