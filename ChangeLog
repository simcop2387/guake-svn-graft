2007-10-02  Lincoln de Sousa  <lincoln@minaslivre.org>

	* src/guake.py (PrefsDialog):
	* src/guake.py (PrefsDialog.load_configs): Widget spinHistorySize renamed
	to historysize-spinbutton to follow the name of other widgets, because of
	this, the callback on_spinHistorySize_value_changed was renamed to
	on_historysize_spinbutton_value_changed. Removed animate flag button
	changer.

	* src/guake.py (PrefsDialog.load_configs): Adding warnings when unable to
	parse a color.

	* src/guake.py (PrefsDialog.on_show_scrollbar_checkbutton_toggled): Pep8'ed

	* src/guake.py
	  (PrefsDialog.on_bgimage_filechooserbutton_selection_changed): little var
	  name clean.

	* src/guake.py (Guake.refresh): Comment updated, misspell fixed.

	* src/guake.py (Guake.show): Moving add_tab call to be called before
	self.window.show, to avoid blank screens before adding a tab. And some
	unuseful function calls removed. Not this method resizes and shows the main
	window, see the next entry to understand why.

	* src/guake.py (Guake.animate_hide, Guake.animate_show): Removed, we will
	wait a better moment to implement animated things, now Guake.show and
	Guake.hide makes the work alone.

	* data/guake.glade: window-root is not a popup any more, now it's a
	toplevel window, his type_hint is Normal by default, etc. The
	notebook-terminals widget had his tabs hidden by default, now it can has
	focus, all borders were set to 0, empty pages were removed, because it is
	added by code, not in the glade file. toolbar widget height was set to 22.

	* data/prefs.glade: spinHistorySize widget was renamed to
	historysize-spinbutton (his change signall too), padding and spacing
	changed in many places, misspell fixed in "Hide on lose focus" and remove
	option to choose animated show/hide.

	* src/guake.py: Adding a call to test_gconf in main section of module.

2007-06-17  Gabriel Falcao <gabrielteratos@gmail.com>

	* data/guake.schema: Adding two more keys: scrollbar visibe (bool) and
	history size(int)

	* data/prefs.glade: Adding widget to setup scrollback lines (aka. history
	size)

	* data/prefs.glade: Adding widget to setup scrollbar visibility

	* src/guake.py: Added respective methods to handle history size and

2007-06-17  Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>

	function in simpleglade.py)

	* src/guake.py: Calling bindtextdomain function to setup translation,
	changing guakeabt.png image name to guake.png, little code cleanup,

	* src/guake.py (Guake): Some methods was moved to be nearer to methods that
	does closed things (load_config and load_accelerators specifically). Added
	accel_* methods to avoid Control caracters in terminal widget (these
	methods are connected to a key action, and they returns True -- this is the
	trick)

	* src/guake.py (Guake.update_preview_cb): Changing number of params (self
	was not there =/) and removing unecessary try/except and using a simple if.
	The image size was changed too.

	* src/guake.py (guake.set_last_pos,add_tab): Improved the way to get the
	current tab shown.

	* src/guake.py (Guake.on_terminal_exited): Adding a new parameter (term) to
	this callback. It was necessary because when a terminal exits the widget
	sent is not a terminal, after the change above, it must be sent as
	user_data to this callback.

	* src/simplegladeapp.py: Commenting setlocale call to avoid problems with
	languages with sufixes (as pt_BR.utf8)

	* data/guake.glade,
	* data/prefs.glade,
	* data/about.glade: Removing image path references, because libglade does
	not have a parameter to set `pixmap dir', so we make it in python.

	* src/guake: Renamed to src/guake.in

	* src/guake.in: Added to be the main script instead of guake.py, it only calls
	guake.run function.

	LIBDIR with libdir value and adding `src/guake' as an output file.
