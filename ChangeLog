	* src/guakeApplet.py: Removed.

	* TODO: Added more issues, this will be our standard roadmap before
	using a tracker =)

2007-06-01  Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>

	* src/guake.py: Code cleanup, renaming some methods, to remove the
	mixedCase style and use the underscore_separated style.

2007-05-30  Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>

	* src/guake.in: Became a shell script, to avoid problems with dbus.

	* src/guake.py: Code cleanup and adding methods that will be called by
	dbus. Renamed method addTerm to add_tab. Changed dbus object name.

	* src/dbusiface.py: Changed name of object from DBus to DBusInterface, and
	changed the way to inform user that dbus will not be available.

	* data/add_tab.svg: Added -- This is a copy of addTerm.svg and was copied
	only because addTerm method has its name changed in guake.py file,
	addTerm.svg still in data dir and will only be removed when we do the
	cleanup in image file names.

	* data/Makefile.am: Added add_tab.svg file in data dir.

2007-05-30  Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>

	* autogen.sh: Sending all parameters from this to gnome-autogen.sh.

	* configure.ac: Adding more two expanded variables (BINDIR and DATADIR) and
	adding more two output files.

	* TODO: Updating with closed things.

	* src/guake_globals.py.in: Changing paths to be more customizable by the
	configure script.

	* data/Makefile.am: Adding desktop file, dbus service file and schema file.

	* data/guake.desktop.in,
	* data/org.gnome.Guake.service.in: Added

2007-05-27  Lincoln de Sousa <lincoln@archlinux-br.org>
	* data/guake.glade,
	* data/prefs.glade,
	* data/about.glade: Removing image path references, because libglade does
	not have a parameter to set `pixmap dir', so we make it in python.

	* src/guake: Renamed to src/guake.in

	* src/guake.in: Added to be the main script instead of guake.py, it only calls
	guake.run function.

	* m4/*: Added.

	* configure.ac: Adding m4 as macro dir, adding a call to AS_AC_EXPAND set
	LIBDIR with libdir value and adding `src/guake' as an output file.

	* src/Makefile.am: Changing guake dir from prefix/bin to bindir. It was
	made to able the user to change bin dir with the `configure' script.

	* src/common.py,
	* src/guake.py: datapath function was splitted in pixmapfile and gladefile
	functions because if this project doesn't stop to grow, we will separate
	images from glade files in data dir.

	* src/guake.py: Adding image references told above and some code cleanup.
