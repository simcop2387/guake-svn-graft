Guake README file
=================

INTRO
~~~~~
Guake code is placed in the src directory.
We use python system to build guake modules and to generate distribution
packages, because it's easy to maintain and because we like python =D


DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Python2.4+
 * pygtk2.10 (gtk.StatusIcon)
 * pynotify (optional)


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install guake use the setup.py script. You can use the following command
to do this::

    $ python setup.py install


PACKAGERS
~~~~~~~~~
The python way to create packages have also distribution specific features,
like generate .rpm or .deb files. But if you are interested in make Guake
available in other distributions, you can ask setup.py to install in your
package build dir with the following command::

    $ python setup.py install --root=/path/to/your/package/dir


TRANSLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to translate Guake to your locale, please run po-extract. That
script will generate a file called `messages.pot`. Please edit this file with
your prefered po editor (like poedit, gtranslator, etc) and please send us
your work. And do not forget to rename messages.pot to your language.po, for
example `pt_BR.po`

NOTE: To compile the .po file to .mo, type::

    $ msgfmt pt_BR.po -o po/pt/LC_MESSAGES/meuprograma.mo
